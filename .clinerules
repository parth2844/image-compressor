# Cline Rules for Image Compressor Project

## Memory Bank Protocol

### On Session Start
1. **Always read all Memory Bank files first:**
   - `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Core requirements and constraints
   - `memory-bank/productContext.md` - Why and how the product works
   - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and component patterns
   - `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Tech stack and dependencies
   - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current focus and recent changes
   - `memory-bank/progress.md` - What's done and what's remaining

2. **Understand the context before making changes**

### On Session End (or Significant Changes)
Update the Memory Bank when:
- Adding new components or features
- Changing architecture or patterns
- Completing major milestones
- Making decisions that affect future development

Files to update:
- `activeContext.md` - Always update with current focus
- `progress.md` - Update completion status and session log
- `systemPatterns.md` - If new patterns were introduced

## Project Guidelines

### Tech Stack
- React 18 + Vite 6
- Tailwind CSS 3 (utility classes only, no custom CSS)
- browser-image-compression library
- JSZip + FileSaver for downloads

### Architecture
- Functional components with hooks
- Custom hooks for shared logic (see `useImages.js`)
- Utils folder for pure functions
- All processing is client-side (Canvas API + Web Workers)

### Code Style
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes over custom CSS
- Use semantic HTML where possible
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Document complex logic with comments

### GitHub
- Repository: https://github.com/parth2844/image-compressor
- Branch: main
- Commit messages should be descriptive

## Key Constraints
- **No backend** - GitHub Pages static hosting only
- **Privacy first** - Files never leave the browser
- **Free forever** - No paid services or APIs
